### Contributing

Hey, if you want to contribute updates, I'd appreciate it! 

Using git is a whole world of its own, so send me an email or open a Github issue with any questions you have.

Some prerequisites to have installed:
 - python2
 - workbox

Basic instructions are:
 - Update the church listing in the `map/data.json` file
 - Run `build/prepare.sh`

Then open a pull request!
